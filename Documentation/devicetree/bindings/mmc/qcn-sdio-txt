QCN SDIO function-1 driver
==========================

The QCN7605 device uses a Q6-WCSS DSP co-processor. The Q6-WCSS requires a
firmware binary to boot. The QCN SDIO function-1 driver provides the means with
to communicate with the device. The commuincation involves firmware download,
multiprocessor communication, and other subsytem's coreesponding data download
and upload.

Example: WLAN traffic, WLAN BDF, M3 or CALDATA download etc.

QCN SDIO Device Node:
=====================
A QCN SDIO device node is used to represent the function-1 driver instance. It
is needed as a child node to SOC parent node through which it is accessible to
the host.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Should be one of,
				"qcom,qcn-sdio" for MSM8996 SOCs

Example:
--------
/* MSM8996 */
soc {
	qcom,qcn-sdio {
		compatible = "qcom,qcn-sdio";
	}
};
